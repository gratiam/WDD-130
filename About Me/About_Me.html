        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
            My name is Graham, and I'm currently about to turn 16! <br>
        </p>
        <!-- Main information -->
        <p>
            I've always been interested in going into coding/programming, but had a lot of trouble getting started. <br>
            I currently reside in Rhode Island with my family, and am taking Dual Enrollement for this course.  I've heard a lot of good things about web-design, so I've been excited for this course! <br>
            I've already learned so much more than I expected from the helpful videos provided, and look forward to the rest of the class! <br>
            Last semester I took a course on Python, so I'm quite interested in seeing how much the thought-process carries over to this language.<br>
        </p>
        <!-- Scripture -->
        <p>
            My favorite scripture is section 129 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which lists the "three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God."<br>
            I find it very fascinating, as it gives an incredible amount of insight as to the nature of things we have not previously known.<br>Although it's unlikely I'll ever be able to make use of the "shaking hands" method, it's interesting to know nonetheless. <br>
            I'd recommend you read the section if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's only 9 verses!
